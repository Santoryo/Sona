## Setup
1. To use Sona out of the box you can download it from [Releases](https://github.com/Santoryo/Sona/releases)
2. Sona uses lockfile to connect to [LCU API](https://hextechdocs.dev/getting-started-with-the-lcu-api/), the default installation for League of Legends is for `C:\Riot Games\League of Legends` if you have League installed in other place, please edit `config.ini` to your matching League of Legends installation
3. Sona will only get the info from Spotify / Tidal application that is installed on your computer. Please note that Sona will not work if you use Spotify / Tidal Web Player.

## Customization
You might want to customize your status a little bit, it is possible with `config.ini` that is located in the installation directory.
``` ini
[SETTINGS]
format =  ▶️ {artist} - {song} #format of the song, use wildcards {artist} or {song} to display the info respectively.
onMusicStopReverseStatus = False #if its True then it will reverse to original status that you had setup before turning on Sona.
formatStop = ⏸️ {artist} - {song} #if onMusicStopReverseStatus = False then formatStop is taken into the accountant
updateTime = 1 #update time of statusMessage, 1-3 seconds are recommended
LeaguePath = C:\Riot Games\League of Legends #League of Legends installation folder
Service = Spotify #Available services: Spotify Tidal
```
